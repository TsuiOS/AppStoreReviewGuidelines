### 加速审核

因为严重BUG我已经成功申请了两次加速审核了

加速审核的时候再次被拒怎么办?

这里申请成功之后给发的邮件! 如果加速审核的时候再次被拒,重新提交依然会回到加速队列中
> Thank you for contacting App Store Review to request an expedited review.We understand that situations arise which require an exceptional response, so we have made an additional exception for your app and will proceed with an expedited review.If your app is rejected during this review, it is not necessary to request another Expedited Review when you resubmit. Once you revise and resubmit your binary (or metadata, in the case of a Metadata Rejection), your app will be automatically returned to the expedite queue.We would like to remind you that expedited reviews are provided on a limited basis. Please keep in mind that we may not be able to accommodate additional requests in the future.Best regards,App Store Review
